## Report
### Sequence Quality Histograms
The mean quality value across each base position in the read.
![Mean Quality Score](./png/mqc_fastqc_per_sequence_quality_scores_plot_1.png)
### Per Sequence Quality SCores
The number of reads with average quality scores. Shows if a subset of reads has poor quality.
![Per Seq QC](./png/mqc_fastqc_per_sequence_quality_scores_plot_1.png)
### Per Base Sequence COntent
The proportion of each base position for which each of the four normal DNA bases has been called.
![Per BAse Seq Content](./png/mqc_fastqc_per_base_sequence_quality_plot_1.png)
### Per Sequence GC Content
The average  GC content of reads. Normal random library typically have a roughly normal distribution of GC content.

### Per Base N COntent
The percentage of bases calles at each position for which an N was called.

### Sequence legth distribution
### Sequence Duplication Levels
The relative level of duplication found for every sequence.
![Seq duplicate levels](./png/mqc_fastqc_sequence_duplication_levels_plot_1.png)
### Adapter Content
The cumulative percentage count of the proportion of your library which has seen each of the adapter sequences at each position.
