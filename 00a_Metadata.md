## Maize Dataset:
[Bioproject: PRJNA260793](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA260793)

[Associated Publication: Johnston et al., 2014](http://www.plantcell.org/content/26/12/4718)


* The maize leaf is an ideal system to study plant morphogenesis
* It is divided into a proximal (close to stem) sheath and a distal blade each with distinct developmental patterning.
* Specialized epidermal fringe ligule and auricle structures form at the blade-sheath boundary.
